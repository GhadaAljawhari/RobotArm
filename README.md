Arduino Robot Arm Project Report_Smart Methods Summer Internship



*Note: The dimensions of the arm are only approximations, they must be modified according to user's needs. 

This is one of the projects required to complete the Smart Methods summer training, the following instructions must be followed for installation.

1.	İnstall the base as shown, make sure the wider terminal is facing down. 
2.	Adjust the waist on the base, remember to match the screw holes. 
3.	İnstall the first arm (Arm 01), set in zero position. 
4.	Connect the second arm (Arm 02) to the opposite side from which you connected the first arm to the waist. Use appropriate parts to connect them. 
5.	Tie the gripper to the second arm’s end, make sure that the gripper’s size is appropriate before printing. 
6.	Ensure that the entire range of motion is achieved at every joint.
